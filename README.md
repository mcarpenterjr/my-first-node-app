# BOOYAH!

I am diving into to learning nodejs. This is the application I am buiilding as I learn more about this absoloutely epic technology.

As a certified Front End Dev, titled Software Developer and life long web developer I know enough PHP, Full Stack and srver administration to be dangerous. Hopefully the outcome of this adventure in node will give me a little more focus and ability to create the right design patterns. I already know it will become another part of my constantly growing skillset.
